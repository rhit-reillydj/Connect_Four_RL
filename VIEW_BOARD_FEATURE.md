# View Board Feature Implementation

## Overview
Added a "View Board" button to the victory, defeat, and draw screens that allows players to view the final board state without the overlay, then return to the results screen.

## Features Added

### 1. **View Board Button**
- Added to all game over screens (victory, defeat, draw)
- Positioned next to the existing "Try Again?" button
- Styled with a green color to indicate a "view" action

### 2. **Board View Mode**
- When clicked, hides the game over overlay
- Shows the final board state with the game result message
- Displays "Back to Results" and "Try Again?" buttons below the board

### 3. **State Management**
- New session state variable: `st.session_state.viewing_board`
- Toggles between showing overlay (False) and viewing board (True)
- Maintains all existing game state logic

## User Flow

1. **Game Ends** → Victory/Defeat/Draw overlay appears with two buttons:
   - "View Board" (green) - Shows the final board
   - "Play Again?" / "Try Again?" / "Rematch?" (red) - Restarts the game

2. **Click "View Board"** → Overlay disappears, final board visible with:
   - Game result message at top
   - "Back to Results" button (blue) below the board
   - "Try Again?" button (red) below the board

3. **Click "Back to Results"** → Returns to the victory/defeat overlay

4. **Click "Try Again?" (from any state)** → Restarts the game

## Technical Implementation

### New Session State Variables
- `st.session_state.viewing_board` - Boolean controlling overlay visibility
- `st.session_state.last_view_board_timestamp` - Bridge event deduplication
- `st.session_state.last_back_to_results_timestamp` - Bridge event deduplication

### New Bridge Handlers
- `view_board_signal` - Triggered when "View Board" is clicked
- `back_to_results_signal` - Triggered when "Back to Results" is clicked

### New Functions
- `display_board_view_controls()` - Shows floating controls when viewing board

### Modified Functions
- `display_win_celebration()` - Added button container with both buttons
- `display_loss_devastation()` - Added button container with both buttons  
- `display_draw_message()` - Added button container with both buttons
- Game over display logic - Conditionally shows overlay vs board view

### CSS Additions
- `.button-container` - Responsive flex container for multiple buttons
- `.view-board-button-overlay` - Green styling for view board button
- `.board-view-controls` - Positioning for controls below the board
- `.board-view-button-container` - Flex container for board view buttons
- `.back-to-results-button` - Blue styling for navigation button
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Browser Compatibility
- Uses modern CSS features like `clamp()` for responsive design
- JavaScript bridge communication for button interactions
- Tested with Streamlit's HTML component system

## Mobile Responsiveness
- Buttons stack vertically on small screens
- Floating controls adjust to screen size
- Responsive font sizes and padding

## Future Enhancements
- Could add board analysis features (move history, suggested moves)
- Could add screenshot/save board functionality
- Could implement game replay functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Bridge Element Visibility Issue
The implementation uses Streamlit bridge components for inter-frame communication. These components can create invisible iframes that take up space and push content down. 

**Solution implemented:**
- **Specific bridge key hiding**: Uses CSS to hide bridge elements by their specific keys (`st-key-player_action_bridge_key`, `st-key-restart_game_bridge_key`, etc.)
- **Bridge iframe hiding**: Targets iframes with bridge URLs (`st_bridge.bridge.bridge`) 
- **Absolute positioning**: Moves bridge elements completely out of document flow

**What was avoided:**
- Generic iframe hiding that could interfere with the board display
- Complex CSS selectors with limited browser support (`:has()`)
- JavaScript DOM manipulation that could cause timing issues

This ensures the board displays correctly while hiding only the bridge communication elements.
